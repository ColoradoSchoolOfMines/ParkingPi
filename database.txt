after you have a root user 

use these following lines

create database dbName
create user "user"@"host(usually localhost)" identified by "password"
grant create, drop, alter, delete, index, insert, select, update on *.* to "user"

this will create a database by dbName, a user with username "user" with password "password" and give them the basic premissions.

ParkingPi
=========

The code for the raspberry Pi specfic to the Parking Sensor project

If you want the pi to text you the ip address, you have to 
1. Have a twillo account
2. Have an apache server running(doesn't need to have connection outside of localhost)
3. add your number to the array of numbers(Please remove the numbers of people currently not using that pi)
4. copy YoIpAddressFo folder into /var/www
5. add smsbootscript to startup(google it, there are lots of ways to do this)
